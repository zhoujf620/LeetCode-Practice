#
# A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent
# nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in
# the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through
# the root.
# 
# The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
# 
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty
# path.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 =
# 6.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 42
# Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7
# = 42.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.ans = float('-inf')
        self.dfs(root)
        return self.ans

    def dfs(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0

        left_sum = max(self.dfs(root.left), 0)
        right_sum = max(self.dfs(root.right), 0)
        self.ans = max(self.ans, left_sum + right_sum + root.val)
        return max(left_sum, right_sum) + root.val
